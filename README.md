# chef-registration

Semester 2 registration form built with Next.js, MySQL, and Prisma.

## Backend setup

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Create a MySQL database:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE chef_registration;
```

3. Create a local `.env` file from `.env.example` and set your MySQL URL:

```bash
DATABASE_URL="mysql://root:password@localhost:3306/chef_registration"
ADMIN_SESSION_SECRET="replace-with-at-least-32-random-characters"
AWS_REGION="ap-southeast-1"
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="your-access-key-id"
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="your-secret-access-key"
S3_BUCKET_NAME="chef-registration-receipts"
```

4. Apply the SQL migration:

```bash
npm run db:migrate
```

5. Start the app:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The registration API writes form data to the `registrations` SQL table. Uploaded receipts are saved in a private S3 bucket, and the database stores the S3 object key plus receipt metadata.

The S3 bucket should stay private. Give the app credentials only the permissions it needs for the receipt bucket:

```txt
s3:PutObject
s3:GetObject
```

## Admin portal

Open `/admin` to sign in.

Default admin account seeded by the migration:

```txt
Username: admin
Password: Admin@2026!
```

Change this password before using the app with real student data.

To change the password from the app:

1. Sign in at `/admin`.
2. Hover over the `admin` account button in the dashboard header.
3. Select `Change Password`.
4. You can also open `/admin/change-password` directly while signed in.
5. Enter the current password and the new password.

Only signed-in admins can access the change password page or API.
